Chris Broussard went as far to say that, even if Draymond‚Äôs reputation is not taken into account, the foul is nothing short of a flagrant 2.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies matchup lived up to its hype and more. The game was an absolute feast to the eyes for the fans. 48 minutes of game time and 48 minutes of uncertainty. The lead was being exchanged through out the game, with Dubs taking home the win in a game that went down the wire.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Read more: <a href=#>‚ÄúThanks for avenging my ejection‚Äù Draymond Green cannot control his happiness‚Ä¶</a></p><p>Despite the thrill the game provided, Draymond was the first topic for everyone to discuss. Draymond is the key to Warrior‚Äôs defence and offence. His ejection surely did turn the tables. But along with thrill, the game also served a massive plate of controversy. And its that one plate that everybody wants a taste of.</p><p>Many NBA analysts, players and former players have come to the defence of Draymond and have called the officials ‚Äòinconsistent‚Äô and ‚Äòsoft‚Äô. They are not wrong either as while they were in the league, a play like Draymond‚Äôs would usually cost 2 free throws. And had it been an another player other than Green, the ruling surely would not have had been the same. Flagrant 2 to most seems excessive as it does not quite meet the circumstances of the situation in this case.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chris_Broussard_on_Draymond_Greens_ejection></span>Chris Broussard on Draymond Green‚Äôs ejection<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"Draymond deserved to be ejected.

From his perspective, Draymond did pull Brandon Clarke down. According to him there was unnecessary contact and because Brandon was airborn when Draymond ‚Äòslapped his face and pulled his jersey‚Äô the play was dangerous.</p><p>Draymond, in his defence, stated that he attempted to block the shot so that he could stop a ‚Äòbucket and one‚Äô. He did not intend to pull the jersey and rather tried to save Brandon from getting hurt. Draymond pointed out that he still had his hands on Brandon‚Äôs jersey so that he could help him up. &nbsp;Draymond‚Äôs veiwpoint has been widely accepted by NBAA players and former players, with them all agreeing Draymond by stating that playoffs are more physical than the easy going regular season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>There's no way Draymond Green should be ejected for that.</p><p>That is one of the worst calls I've ever seen in an NBA playoff game.</p>‚Äî Bonta Hill (@BontaHill) <a href=#>May 1, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Draymond Green gets ejected for a grab and yank of Brandon Clarke's jersey.
