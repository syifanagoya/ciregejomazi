In part I of the novel, Dostoevsky describes Raskolnikov as “having been in an overstrained irritable condition, <b>verging on hypochondria</b>” for some time past (1).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=was-raskolnikov-schizophrenic></span>Was Raskolnikov schizophrenic?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Raskolnikov is a sick man. He is <b>afflicted clearly with schizophrenia</b> and also has some traits of grandiose delusional disorder. According to the DSM-IV, he can be easily diagnosed as a full schizophrenic.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-raskolnikov-have-ocd></span>Does Raskolnikov have OCD?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In my reading, the main character, Raskolnikov, <b>exudes sign of OCD</b>, insomnia, and often has fainting spells. … Another possible cause of Raskolnikov’s insomnia could be related to environmental factors. “He woke up late the next day, after a troubled sleep, but sleep had not fortified him.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-raskolnikov-have-multiple-personalities></span>Does Raskolnikov have multiple personalities?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Prior to this novel, Dostoevsky had used characters whose personalities were dual ones. However, it is not until this novel that he exposes the reader to a full study of the split personality. <b>Raskolnikov’s dual personality is the controlling idea behind the murder and behind his punishment</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-do-sonya-and-raskolnikov-realize-at-the-end-of-the-epilogue></span>What do Sonya and Raskolnikov realize at the end of the epilogue?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>They both realize <b>that he truly loves her</b>. They resolve to wait out the remaining seven years of his prison term. That evening, Raskolnikov thinks about Sonya and experiences the ecstasy of love.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-does-raskolnikov-faint></span>Why does Raskolnikov faint?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>At the end of the chapter, Raskolnikov’s fainting spell is a result of <b>the tension caused by the summons</b>; the oppressive smell of the new paint, which reminds him of the murder scene; the crowded conditions with its lack of fresh air; and finally the discussion of the murder of Alyona Ivanovna.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-kind-of-person-is-raskolnikov></span>What kind of person is Raskolnikov?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Raskolnikov is <b>a poor, unemployed student who struggles to survive</b>. He owes money to his landlady. He doesn’t have money for food or for clothes. He rents a very small, confined space that has room for his couch and little more.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-raskolnikov-an-extraordinary-man></span>Is Raskolnikov an extraordinary man?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky, the protagonist Raskolnikov plans and follows through with a murder. He <b>believes himself to be part of an extraordinary group</b>. … Raskolnikov, although he initially believes himself to be an extraordinary person, is not one.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-raskolnikovs-personality></span>What is Raskolnikov’s personality?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Raskolnikov, the main character of the novel Crime and Punishment by Feodor Dostoevsky, actually possesses two completely contradicting personalities. One part of him is intellectual: <b>cold, unfeeling, inhumane, and exhibiting tremendous self-will</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-raskolnikov-intelligent></span>Is Raskolnikov intelligent?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Raskolnikov’s <b>intellectual side is intricately bound up in his theory of the extraordinary man</b>. If Raskolnikov is to be one of the extraordinary, he must be able to stand alone, without needing human companionship or without being influenced by the actions of others.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-raskolnikov-a-nihilist></span>Is Raskolnikov a nihilist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Raskolnikov lives hypocritically: As <b>a nihilist</b>, he cares nothing for others’ feelings or social conventions, but as a conflicted human, he demands propriety from others.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-dostoevsky-think-of-raskolnikov></span>What does Dostoevsky think of Raskolnikov?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Dostoevsky believes that the <b>moral “freedom”</b> propounded by Raskolnikov is a dreadful freedom “that is contained by no values, because it is before values”. In seeking to affirm this “freedom” in himself, Raskolnikov is in perpetual revolt against society, himself, and God.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-raskolnikov-a-narcissist></span>Is Raskolnikov a narcissist?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>As intelligent, and capable, as Raskolnikov is, he’s also <b>very arrogant, and narcissistic</b>, so he doesn’t quite understand nearly as much as he thinks. … In the end, Raskolnikov accepts his transgressions, turns himself in, and spiritually atones for his crimes in prison.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-raskolnikov-a-peasant></span>Is Raskolnikov a peasant?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>In the dream, Raskolnikov shows his dual nature at work. He is <b>both the peasant Mikolka</b> who cruelly beats the horse to death and also the boy who feels great compassion for the suffering horse.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-sonia-in-crime-and-punishment></span>How old is Sonia in crime and punishment?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>nineteen Answer and Explanation:<p>Sonya is <b>nineteen</b> during the main events of Crime and Punishment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46dpp6rXaeutLfOpaWio5%2Breqmt1Z5kmmWdmru1rctmoKWknprAtHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-you-fix-a-screen-door-that-slams-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How do you fix a screen door that slams?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-zehra-gunes-boyfriend-know-everything-about-her-love-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Zehra Gne's boyfriend?
