Because of <b>child labor laws</b>, it’s easier to cast actors who are over 18 as high school students than it is to work with labor regulations regarding younger actors.</p><p>Moreover, What does Sandy say to Danny at the end of Grease?</p><p>Sandy : Danny… is this the end? Danny : Of course not; it’s only the beginning. Sandy : <b>You’re a fake and a phony and I wish I never laid eyes on you.</b></p><p>Also Why did Sonny take Sandy away in Grease?</p><p>Sure Sonny was a bit of a jerk, but he idolized Danny and would never disrespect him. Chosen answer: It’s so Cha-Cha can go with Danny. You can see Cha-Cha giving Danny the eye. So Sonny took Sandy away <b>for Cha-Cha’s benefit</b>.</p><p>Why is Grease 2 SO BAD?</p><p>Even so, Grease 2 didn’t just fall short – <b>it flopped with gusto</b>. Despite having almost twice the budget of the first film, it barely made back its costs. The film was critically mauled, and – aside from Michelle Pfeiffer, who was likely on her way to great things anyway – it didn’t propel anyone to stardom.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=26_Related_Question_Answers_Found></span>26 Related Question Answers Found<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Sandy_and_Danny_die></span><strong>Did Sandy and Danny die?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Ending (And “Goodbye Sandra Dee”) <b>Confirm Sandy Died</b></p><p>And it’s not just her: Rizzo’s pregnancy scare, the dance competition that Danny wins (albeit with Cha-Cha), the drag race on Thunder Road… Everything ends with a happy ending, no matter what the seeming obstacles.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Do_Danny_and_Sandy_kiss_in_Grease></span><strong>Do Danny and Sandy kiss in Grease?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Danny and Sandy finally get their movie-<b>ending</b> ‘Grease’ kiss, 40 years after it was cut.
