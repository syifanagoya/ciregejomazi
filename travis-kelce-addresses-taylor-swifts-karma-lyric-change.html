She <a href=#>canceled her Friday concert</a> due to excessive rain — Travis joked on the podcast that “lightning and electronics don’t mesh very well,” referring to Swift’s stage setup — but Travis was <a href=#>spotted shaking it off in the audience</a> when Swift took the stage on Saturday, November 11. He joined Swift’s dad, who was wearing a Kansas City Chiefs lanyard, in the VIP tent.</p><p>Swift acknowledged Travis in the crowd a handful of times throughout the three-hour show, but her lyric change in “Karma” drew the biggest reaction. While closing out her set, Swift sent fans into a frenzy by singing <a href=#>“Karma is the guy on the Chiefs”</a> instead of “Karma is the guy on the screen.” Footage shared via social media showed Travis blushing at the sweet shout-out.</p><p>When Jason, 36, brought up the now-viral moment, Travis initially said he “had no clue” what Swift was planning. “Well, I might have had a little bit of a clue,” he continued. “But definitely, when I heard it come out of her mouth, it still shocked me. I was like, ‘Oh … she really just said that.'”</p><p>Jason joked that his brother was “so shocked” that he failed to give Swift’s dad a high-five. “Mr. Swift, I apologize, big guy,” Travis said. “I never miss a high-five too, big high-five guy. It’s the most electric thing you could do at an event.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Blown-Away-by-Taylor-Swift-Concert-in-Argentina-Karma-Lyric-Change-2.jpg><p>Travis was seen interacting with Scott at other points during the concert — and <a href=#>had very different reactions</a> when Swift was performing her steamy “Vigilante S–t” choreography. She and Travis, who have been linked since September, were later spotted kissing backstage after the show.</p><p>“I was blown away. … The show was even more electric knowing that I had a little bit more to enjoy [it] for,” Travis gushed on Wednesday. “Taylor absolutely ripped it. She killed it. It looked like she was having some fun up there.”</p><p>He went on to tell Jason, “We gotta get you to a concert. … I’m telling you, it’ll blow you away.”</p><p>Travis previously saw The Eras Tour in July at his NFL team’s home turf, Arrowhead Stadium, in Kansas City. He revealed on “New Heights” after the show that <a href=#>he tried to exchange numbers with Swift</a> but wasn’t able to meet her at the time. She later attended one of <a href=#>his football games</a> in September — and the pair’s romance has been heating up ever since.</p><p>While Swift has been more tight-lipped about the budding relationship, Travis hasn’t shied away from publicly discussing his love life. When the twosome stepped out for multiple date nights in New York City last month — and made surprise cameos on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live — Travis recapped the weekend on his and Jason’s podcast.</p><p>“We showed up at SNL with the idea of supporting Ice Spice, her and Taylor are friends. I’ve always wanted to meet [host] Pete Davidson, been a fan of his for quite a while … It was electric to be back in that place,” Travis said on the October 14 episode. “There is just something about being in that room.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>A source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that Swift was “falling for [Travis] more and more as the days go by,” adding that Travis “goes out of his way to make Taylor feel special in any way he can.”</p><p>Their relationship <a href=#>has only gotten stronger</a> — and they’ve put thought into how to make long-distance dating work while Swift is on tour. “Travis and Taylor are a very real couple, they actually spend a lot of one-on-one time together and have developed a very real connection,” a second insider told Us earlier this month. “They have very detailed plans coming up on how to stay together while she’s on tour and he has games.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dlrGlvsSsqp6rXamuurjOq2Ssr5mbwbR5ypqpppldocaztcJmmqGZnpyycA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-paulson-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Paulson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./playboi-carti-net-worth-2020-2021.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Playboi Carti Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Dating, Bio-Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./william-denis-browne-net-worth.html>What is WilliamDenis Browne Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-crown-netflix-in-talks-prequel-series.html>Netflix's The Crown in talks to create prequel series - get the details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jesseca-dupart.html>Jesseca Dupart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Children, Family and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./monique-evans-net-worth.html>Monique Evans Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billionaire-patrick-dovigi-sells-miami-area-mansion-for-23-million.html>Billionaire Patrick Dovigi Sells Miami Area Mansion For $23 Million</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
