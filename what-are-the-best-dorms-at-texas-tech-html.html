With a housing contract, you must have an eating plan.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-152 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en>What is the total number of dormitories at Texas Tech?</span></h3><p><span lang=en>More than 7,000 students are housed in the Texas Tech University Residence Hall system, which includes 14 residence halls, three suite-style halls, and one apartment complex.

This relaxation of Tech’s longstanding “dry campus” policy would jeopardise student safety and the university’s overall objective.</span></p><p><span lang=en>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en>Is Texas Tech a costly school?</span></h3><p><span lang=en>In-state residents at Texas Tech University pay $6,576 per year in tuition. In Texas, tuition ranks 31st among four-year universities in terms of affordability, while it is the 62nd most expensive four-year college in the state. The tuition is $16,536 for out-of-state students, which is a 151 percent increase.</span></p><p><span lang=en>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en>What are Texas Tech’s most well-known majors?</span></h3><p><span lang=en>Business, Management, Marketing, and Related Support Services; Engineering; Multi/Interdisciplinary Studies; Communication, Journalism, and Related Programs; and Family and Consumer Sciences/Human Sciences are among the most popular majors at Texas Tech University.</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-154 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><span lang=en>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en>What is the minimum SAT score required for Texas Tech?</span></h3><p><span lang=en>The New SAT score in the 25th percentile is 1070, while the 75th percentile is 1240. To put it another way, a 1070 puts you below average, and a 1240 puts you over average. Texas Tech does not have an exact SAT requirement, but they do want to see at least a 1070 in order to be considered.</span></p><p><span lang=en>&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span lang=en>To go into Texas Tech, what GPA do I need?</span></h3><p><span lang=en>With a 3.57 GPA, Texas Tech expects you to be in the middle of your high school class. You’ll need a mix of A’s and B’s, with a few C’s thrown in for good measure. If you have a poor GPA, you may make up for it by taking more difficult courses such as AP or IB subjects. This will help you raise your weighted GPA and demonstrate your college readiness.</span></p><p><span lang=en>&nbsp;</span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-155 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><span lang=en>What is the cost of a semester at TTU?</span></h3><p><span lang=en>Texas Tech University’s undergraduate tuition and fees for the 2018-2019 academic year are $9,080 for Texas residents and $19,040 for out-of-state students.
