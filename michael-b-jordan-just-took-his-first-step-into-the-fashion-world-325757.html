Reportedly, Mr. Jordan began his working relationship with Coach Menswear to launch his very first capsule collection.</p><p>The actor purportedly took inspiration from the popular anime show, Naruto, as well as other cultural ideas and influences congruent with his personality and image. In a statement, the Creed star claimed his work with the company was part and parcel a reflection of his attitudes toward bringing in “fresh perspectives” as well as “unique voices.”</p><p>The line was launched on Tuesday, and it’s comprised of a few different kinds of products, including bags, footwear, jackets, hoodies, as well as t-shirts. The price range is perhaps outside of regular consumer range, however, starting from $95 and going up all the way until $2,500.</p><p>Jordan wrote in his statement that his designs were created in such a way to be worn by his friends, family, acquaintances, and fans, with pride. As fans of the Black Panther alum know, he has shown his love for fashion and design a few times in the past, including at the 2019 SAG Awards.</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn’t until he starred in Coach’s 2019 campaign back in Fall that things really started coming together. The actor praised the Creative Director of the company, Stuart Vevers, for allowing him to bring some of his ideas to life.</p><p>As most know, Mr. Jordan first came to prominence in the massive hit film, Black Panther, which came out back in 2017 and rocked the box offices as well as critics. Since then, Jordan has had lead roles in other big movies, including Creed and its sequel, Creed 2, among others.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>His good looks and charm have made him the target of interested women, with even Tiffany Haddish, the stand-up comedian and actress, taking her shot at him in a number of interviews, including during an appearence on Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club, hosted by Charlamagne Tha God among others.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGednrCprcSlZJtlmqS%2Fpa3NZqGuq6RiwbC7ymafoqtdm7azv9Nmqq2doGK2r8DOZquhnV2brrS0yKilZq%2Bfp7mleZJrbHBtZ2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-ross-mathews-moving-on-from-ex-salvador-camarena.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Ross Mathews Moving on From Ex Salvador Camarena?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./al-rosenberg-net-worth-income-salary-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Al Rosenberg Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./william-denis-browne-net-worth.html>What is WilliamDenis Browne Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-crown-netflix-in-talks-prequel-series.html>Netflix's The Crown in talks to create prequel series - get the details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jesseca-dupart.html>Jesseca Dupart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Children, Family and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./monique-evans-net-worth.html>Monique Evans Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billionaire-patrick-dovigi-sells-miami-area-mansion-for-23-million.html>Billionaire Patrick Dovigi Sells Miami Area Mansion For $23 Million</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
