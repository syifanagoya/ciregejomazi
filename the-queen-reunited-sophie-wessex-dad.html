"There had been a lot of musicians in the line-up but when I said I'd met her, she did show some recognition. It was very quick then and I got to speak to her for longer this time, which was lovely. I told her that I have two children at the school and she also asked about the percussion rooms.

Adam Barrett-James, 15, who is in fifth form, recalled: "She asked who was playing, and I told her it was the computer playing the music. She quite liked it!
