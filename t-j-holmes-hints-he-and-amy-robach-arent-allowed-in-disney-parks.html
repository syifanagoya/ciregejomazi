I am going to try to get [my girlfriend] <strong>Rachael [Kirkconnell]</strong> into a race — the Disney 5K,” James, 32, shared. “She loves Disney so any way to entice her into not being mad about me buying so many running shoes.”</p><p>In response, Holmes hinted that he and Robach, 51, <a href=#>wouldn’t be able to join the couple</a>.</p><p>“We would love to run with you down at that 5K. I don’t think we are allowed on the park’s grounds anymore,” he said while laughing with Robach. “We will check. Last we checked, we weren’t.”</p><p>Holmes and Robach <a href=#>worked for ABC as cohosts of the network’s morning talk sho</a><a href=#>w</a> GMA3 for two years. The pair were fired after their romantic relationship made headlines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TJ-Holmes-Hints-He-Amy-Robach-Not-Allowed-at-Disney-Parks-After-Drama-2.jpg><p>Photos first surfaced of Holmes and Robach <a href=#>getting cozy outside of the office</a> in November 2022 despite being married to other people. That same month, Holmes filed for divorce from <strong>Marilee Fiebig</strong> after more than a decade of marriage. Robach also ended her marriage to <strong>Andrew Shue</strong>, whom she married in 2010.</p><p>Us Weekly broke the news in January 2023 that Robach and Holmes were officially axed from ABC, and the network <a href=#>later confirmed their departure from GMA3.</a></p><p>“After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes, about different options, we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News,” ABC said in a statement at the time. “We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Holmes and Robach initially remained tight-lipped about the scandal. They broke their silence in December 2023 with the release of their podcast, which <a href=#>allowed them to tell their side of the story</a>.</p><p>“To be clear, we were outed as being in a relationship, but everyone else thought we were being outed as adulterers — being outed as cheating on our spouses — and it wasn’t the case because the odd thing is, the day those pictures were taken and the day that article was released, we both at that point were in divorce proceedings,” Holmes said during the debut episode of his and Robach’s new professional venture.</p><p>Robach also defended her romance with Holmes, adding, “We had attorneys, mediators, we were in the middle of divorces. We thought we were protecting our children and our families and we thought we had time and we thought we had a right to privacy and maybe that was foolish and silly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatZZpitbC4zJ6qZqCZo8G0eceeZJqmlGKursWMq6abmZOdeqK%2BxKerZpmcoby4scNmoKdllJ7Ar7HYZqeaqpuofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alexa-chung-tom-sturridge-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alexa Chung and Tom Sturridge's full relationship timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryce-harper-thinks-he-could-be-the-first-400-million-man.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryce Harper Thinks He Could Be The First $400 Million ManAnd He Might Be Right!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./william-denis-browne-net-worth.html>What is WilliamDenis Browne Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-crown-netflix-in-talks-prequel-series.html>Netflix's The Crown in talks to create prequel series - get the details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jesseca-dupart.html>Jesseca Dupart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Children, Family and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./monique-evans-net-worth.html>Monique Evans Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billionaire-patrick-dovigi-sells-miami-area-mansion-for-23-million.html>Billionaire Patrick Dovigi Sells Miami Area Mansion For $23 Million</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
