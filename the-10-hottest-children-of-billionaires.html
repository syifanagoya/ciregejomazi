Some people inherit good looks from their relatives. Then there are the lucky few that manage to inherit both lots of money and good looks. If they have also inherited a modicum of intelligence and some business acumen as well, they often do quite well for themselves, separate from their famously wealthy parents. Here is a quick list of some of the wealthiest and most attractive <strong>children of billionaires</strong>. While beauty is certainly in the eye of the beholder, it's clear that having a secure fiscal portfolio also seems to give these men and women a certain glow. With a combined <strong>net worth of $189.7 Billion</strong>, these 10 people can pay to stay looking young and fabulous until the world stops turning.</p><p><strong>Carlos Slim Domit</strong> – Son of Carlos Slim Helu</p><p><strong>Dad's Net Worth: $70 Billion</strong></p><p>Carlos Slim Domit is the son of the man who was the richest person on Earth from 2010 to 2013, <a href=#>Carlos Slim Helu</a>. Born in 1976, Carlos Slim Domit went on to graduate from Mexico's Universidad Anahuac before joining his father's wildly successful telecommunications company, Grupo Carso. Since 1998, he has served as the company's Chairman of the Board. When not making insane amounts of money, he can be found watching race car driving with his wife, Maria Elena Torruco.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-145442 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/slim2-e1430238433461.jpg alt="Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/GettyImages" width=670 height=654 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-145442 class=wp-caption-text>Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/GettyImages</p><p><strong>Marta Ortega-Perez</strong> – Daughter of Amancio Ortega</p><p><strong>Dad's Net Worth: $62 Billion</strong></p><p>Marta Ortega-Perez is the daughter of <a href=#>Amancio Ortega</a>, the founder of Inditex. If Inditex doesn't sound familiar, maybe its most popular retail brand might — Zara. Like many of the people on this list, Marta will most likely take over her father's company when he retires. Unlike many of the people on this list, however, Marta is probably the only one who actually had to work her way up the ladder to her current spot as an executive with the company. Her first job was working as a retail sales associate and stocker at a local Zara shop. When she's not preparing to take over the family business, she can be found riding horses. She's an accomplished equestrian. In 2012, she married Sergio Alvarez Moya, one of Spain's most well-respected equestrian champions.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-145443 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/marta.jpg alt="(Photo by Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images)" width=670 height=1005 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-145443 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Vanisha Mittal</strong> – Daughter of <a href=# title="Lakshmi Mittal Net Worth">Lakshmi Mittal</a></p><p><strong>Dad's Net Worth: $13.6 Billion</strong></p><p>Vanisha Mittal is the daughter of Indian steel magnate, Lakshmi Mittal.
