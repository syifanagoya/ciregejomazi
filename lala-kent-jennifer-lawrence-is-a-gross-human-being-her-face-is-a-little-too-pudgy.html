That’s it. The end. Taylor Swift should have have figured that out before she started sh-t with Kim Kardashian’s husband. LeAnn Rimes should have figured that out before she started sh-t with Brandi Glanville for the millionth time. America should have figured that out before we started sh-t with Donald Trump. And finally, Jennifer Lawrence should have figured that out before she started sh-t with Lala Kent.</p><p>Lala Kent is on Vanderpump Rules, and J-Law is a flat-out fanatic of Bravo reality programming. Jennifer loves everything about the Real Housewives and the spinoff shows. When she was on Watch What Happens Live, Jennifer <a href=#>called Lala Kent a C-U-Next-Tuesday</a>. Lala Kent has nothing to lose here: an A-list, Oscar-winning actress called her a C-word and now Lala is going to be talking about this sh-t FOREVER. Lala has given another interview about Jennifer Lawrence, and hopefully, this will teach J-Law a much-needed lesson: never start sh-t with a reality star.</p><p>Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent is still upset about Jennifer Lawrence calling her a “c—t” on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.</p><p>“She’s gross,” Kent, 27, began during a Tuesday, March 20, appearance on Heather McDonald’s Juicy Scoop podcast. “Not only did she call me the c-word … she went on and on making fun of me and my relationship with my mom … I’m watching this like ‘Is this A-list celebrity, who has Oscars, for real?’ And then when she dropped the c-word I was like ‘Ok, honey, let’s leave the trash to us reality TV personalities, don’t be trying to take my job.”’</p><p>“Well you know, I just let her know she’s a gross human being and congratulations on two failed films in a row,” the Bravo star continued. “My man is in the movie business, it is now said that she is not as valuable and she has to have another actor or actress to like, get the numbers up.”</p><p>Kent continued to slam Lawrence, and admitted the diss hurt her feelings.</p><p>“You’re an A-list celebrity who makes more money than God and you’re like saying you support women and you’re calling another women the c-word that you’ve never laid eyes on in person, never had a conversation with me,” Kent explained. “I tried to not let it bug me, but it never feels good to be called that, on top of someone who is that big and grand and A-list and glamorous. It was kind of like, ‘That kind of hurt my feelings a little bit.’</p><p>When McDonald asked if she thinks Lawrence did anything sexual with Harvey Weinstein, Kent replied, “Yeah, I think she’s that type of chick.”</p><p>“Well, here’s the thing, now anytime you bring her up, like, I’m going to have nothing nice to say about her,” Kent added. “I’m going say that she sucked everyone’s d—ks to get to where she is, I’m going to say that her hair sucks, her face is a little too pudgy, like she needs to stop the drinking, you know? I said it, you don’t have to worry.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>This is why you don’t start sh-t with a reality star. Say it over and over until you fully comprehend. The Kim Kardashians, Lala Kents, Brandi Glanvilles and Donald Trumps of the world literally have nothing to lose. They live on controversy, they thrive in chaos, they aim to be petty and vulgar. Why not? That’s what makes them famous. That’s why they get paid. So congrats, J-Law: you just got bodied by a Vanderpump Rules reality star. It’s what J-Law deserves, quite honestly. <strong>Updated to clarify</strong>: when I say “it’s what J-Law deserves” I mean that OF COURSE a reality star is going to be dining out on this for months to come. J-Law is not some naif new to Hollywood – she’s a 27-year-old woman who called a reality star a “c–t” on national television. Lala is wrong to say what she says here, but what did Jennifer expect? Maybe she’ll learn not to start sh-t with reality stars.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wenn33829717.jpg alt="'Red Sparrow' Premiere in New York" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbm9gbYF0e8uao5qXm5q7tavJnqWnoZaav6C4wLCpnqaTmqyqv76alqCqn6jAoLTUppinl5Katq%2BzvqGcq5eWlrCmq8islpqXnJ7BtbjEmKuop4%2BlwqWz2Gg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./martha-stewart-net-worth-movies-and-tv-shows-age.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Martha Stewart Net Worth, Movies And TV Shows, Age</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./han-geng-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Han Geng Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./william-denis-browne-net-worth.html>What is WilliamDenis Browne Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-crown-netflix-in-talks-prequel-series.html>Netflix's The Crown in talks to create prequel series - get the details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jesseca-dupart.html>Jesseca Dupart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Children, Family and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./monique-evans-net-worth.html>Monique Evans Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billionaire-patrick-dovigi-sells-miami-area-mansion-for-23-million.html>Billionaire Patrick Dovigi Sells Miami Area Mansion For $23 Million</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
