Each year in the UK there are more than 55,000 new cases, and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 women.

Some people are diagnosed with ‘carcinoma in situ’, where no cancer cells have grown beyond the duct or lobule.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Most cases develop in women over the age of 50 but younger women are sometimes affected. Breast cancer can develop in men though this is rare.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Staging means how big the cancer is and whether it has spread. Stage 1 is the earliest stage and stage 4 means the cancer has spread to another part of the body.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The cancerous cells are graded from low, which means a slow growth, to high, which is fast growing.&nbsp;High grade cancers are more likely to come back after they have first been treated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>What causes breast cancer?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A cancerous tumour starts from one abnormal cell. The exact reason why a cell becomes cancerous is unclear. It is thought that something damages or alters certain genes in the cell. This makes the cell abnormal and multiply ‘out of control’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Although breast cancer can develop for no apparent reason, there are some risk factors that can increase the chance of developing breast cancer, such as genetics.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>What are the symptoms of breast cancer?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The usual first symptom is a painless lump in the breast, although most breast lumps are not cancerous and are fluid filled cysts, which are benign.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The first place that breast cancer usually spreads to is the lymph nodes in the armpit. If this occurs you will develop a swelling or lump in an armpit.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How is breast cancer diagnosed?</span></p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Initial assessment: A doctor examines the breasts and armpits. They may do tests such as a mammography, a special x-ray of the breast tissue which can indicate the possibility of tumours.</li><li class=class>Biopsy: A biopsy is when a small sample of tissue is removed from a part of the body. The sample is then examined under the microscope to look for abnormal cells. The sample can confirm or rule out cancer.</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>If you are confirmed to have breast cancer, further tests may be needed to assess if it has spread. For example, blood tests, an ultrasound scan of the liver or a chest x-ray.</p><img decoding=async id=i-7742bb9054eeb9d6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/08/15/4EEF656900000578-0-image-a-30_1533739503845.jpg height=316 width=588 alt=alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How is breast cancer treated?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Treatment options which may be considered include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone treatment. Often a combination of two or more of these treatments are used.</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>Surgery: Breast-conserving surgery or the removal of the affected breast depending on the size of the tumor.</li><li class=class>Radiotherapy: A treatment which uses high energy beams of radiation focussed on cancerous tissue. This kills cancer cells, or stops cancer cells from multiplying. It is mainly used in addition to surgery.</li><li>Chemotherapy: A treatment of cancer by using anti-cancer drugs which kill cancer cells, or stop them from multiplying</li><li class=class>Hormone treatments: Some types of breast cancer are affected by the ‘female’ hormone estrogen, which can stimulate the cancer cells to divide and multiply. Treatments which reduce the level of these hormones, or prevent them from working, are commonly used in people with breast cancer.</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-bold>How successful is treatment?</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The outlook is best in those who are diagnosed when the cancer is still small, and has not spread. Surgical removal of a tumor in an early stage may then give a good chance of cure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The routine mammography offered to women between the ages of 50 and 70 mean more breast cancers are being diagnosed and treated at an early stage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>For more information visit breastcancernow.org or call its free helpline on 0808 800 6000</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8eemKWsmGK7psPSaKSopZWjwW61zrCYZqaVrMBurc2cn6iqXWeFbq7Rnpikq12ZvLi6jJqqZquYmnqzsdWemKWrXZ2ys3nBq5yaq6RisKK6wp6pZpyZlrSvu9KiqmakmauybrvNZpiiql8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./camerahouse-com-au.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Camera House active coupon codes for December 2023</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-weatherford-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Weatherford Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./william-denis-browne-net-worth.html>What is WilliamDenis Browne Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-crown-netflix-in-talks-prequel-series.html>Netflix's The Crown in talks to create prequel series - get the details</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jesseca-dupart.html>Jesseca Dupart Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Husband, Children, Family and Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./monique-evans-net-worth.html>Monique Evans Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./billionaire-patrick-dovigi-sells-miami-area-mansion-for-23-million.html>Billionaire Patrick Dovigi Sells Miami Area Mansion For $23 Million</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JiveVib.
