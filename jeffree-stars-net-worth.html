He first gained notoriety as a musician on MySpace; then, in 2009, he self-released his album Beauty Killer.</p><p>The single “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Lollipop Luxury</strong></a>” was a smash hit for Star and the starred rapper Nicki Minaj.</p><p>Star joined Akon’s Konvict Muzik label in 2010 and was dubbed “<strong>the next Lady Gaga</strong>” by the R&B artist.</p><p>However, the two’s feud erupted, and Star felt dissatisfied with his deal and the music business in particular.</p><p>He departed the music industry in 2013, claiming in 2020 that he didn’t want to leave but was forced to.</p><p>He was on the verge of bankruptcy, and his singing career was virtually over, so he utilized whatever funds he had to start his own cosmetics line.</p><h3>Cosmetics</h3><p>Jeffree launched his eponymous cosmetics line in 2014 with all of his life earnings earned from his music and makeup careers up to that time.</p><p>He later admitted that he was practically broke and that he believed his music career was doomed when he started the company.</p><p>He was one of the first makeup artists to use YouTube to market himself and his brand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/stars-cosmetics-1024x1024.jpg><p>His popularity developed swiftly as a result of friendships with superstars such as Kat Von D.</p><p>His YouTube following grew to 15 million people, with over 1.7 billion video views.</p><p>Moreover, his first creation was a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">velour liquid lipstick series</a>. Within minutes of the launch, all 30,000 units were sold out.</p><p>Following that, he released a range of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lip scrubs</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">highlighter palettes</a>, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">eye-shadow palettes</a>.</p><p>He then developed a range of beauty bags and mirrors, as well as accessories and clothing.</p><p>Jeffree’s line was first carried in a mall-based store in the United States in 2018. However, the majority of his purchases are now fulfilled directly from his Los Angeles warehouse.</p><h3>Investments</h3><p>Along with his makeup line, he is also involved in a number of other commercial initiatives. Jeffree claims to run ten different enterprises.</p><p>“I run a shipment and fulfillment center, a merchandising firm, and I print and create everything myself,” he continued.</p><p>So, aside from my brand, which is my cosmetics company, I currently run about ten businesses.”</p><p>He branched up into the cannabis industry, producing marijuana grinders and other accessories.</p><p>Star is a brilliant business move because the market is booming, and its use is already legal in several jurisdictions.</p><h3>Book Publications</h3><p>As per the research, Jeffree has not written any book so far. Therefore, it is yet to be written.</p><p><strong>You might also be interested in <a href=# rel=noopener>George Lucas’s Net Worth: Charity & Lifestyle</a>.</strong></p><h2>Controversy</h2><p>Although the rumored connection between West and Star has yet to be proven, many are pointing to Star’s ties to the Kardashian-Jenner family as a possible motivation for him to date West.</p><p>Kylie Jenner was furious with Star in 2016 after he made several videos attacking Jenner’s makeup products.</p><p>He said her lip kits “suck” and accused her of overcharging for simple goods. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kylie Cosmetics lip gloss</a> wands are also defective, according to Star.</p><p>Over the next few years, Star continued to review Jenner’s items, frequently criticizing them, particularly Jenner’s controversial, high-priced beauty brush set.</p><p>According to Star, Jenner then deleted him from the PR list of beauty gurus who were given free items in exchange for reviews.</p><p>Star went against Jenner again in 2019 when he examined her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kylie Skin products</a> and declared that they were not “Jeffree Star approved.”</p><p>Star was most recently involved in a spat with Mason Disick, Kourtney Kardashian’s 11-year-old son, when the 11-year-old labeled Star “spoiled AF” on a TikTok live stream.</p><p>“I had $500 in my bank account six years ago…,” Star said.
