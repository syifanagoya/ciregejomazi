This means that Canan Moodie's age is 19, though he will celebrate his 20th birth date by November 2022.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike their son and the feats he is striding in the world of South African <a href=#>Rugby</a>, Canan Moodie's parents have not been in the news and are barely known to the general public. Still, he acknowledges the sacrifices that his folks made in his development. It is also unknown whether he has any older or younger siblings.</p><p class=align-left>The 6 feet and three inches tall winger was educated and has gone as far as obtaining a high school diploma. Canan Moodie's school was Klein Boishaai, also known as the Paarl Boys' primary school, before moving on to Boland Landbou<a href=#> high school</a>, where he graduated sometime in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/d99c42bce8dbefa1.jpg><h3>Career</h3><p class=align-left>The story about Canan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Moodie's career </a>in Rugby can be described as a meteoric rise to stardom. He had always <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">loved Rugby as a boy </a>and played in high school games for Landbou before earning his place to play with the Western Cape Academy in his home state of Cape Town. Even then, he sought opportunities to be around more experienced players, even if it meant chasing after miscued shots.</p><p class=align-left>2020 dampened the spirit of sports worldwide due to the coronavirus pandemic, but the opening of sporting activities in the following year brought good news for Moodie. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">penned a professional contract</a> with the popular South African Rugby club, The Bulls.</p><p class=align-left>This contract further placed him on the radar of the coaches of the various age grades of the South African national team, and soon enough, he got an invite to represent the U20 team of his country on the international stage. According to him,</p>Two years ago I was at high school at Boland Landbou playing in front of maybe 1,000 people at a small school, and now I'm on a global stage playing in front of 25,000 people. That's something quite special.<p class=align-left>Canan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Moodie's injury</a> scare to the jaw in a game against the Stormers slowed his trajectory to the top of his game. So, coach Bafana Nhleko dropped and replaced him with Latica Nela.</p><p class=align-left>However, things have changed as he is now being viewed as a replacement for Kurt-Lee Arendse, a South African national rugby team member. Kurt-Lee Arendse, who plays on the wing for the senior team, was suspended until around September 2022.</p><h3>Canan Moodie's net worth</h3><p class=align-left>According to Hollywoods Magazine, his financial fortunes are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">estimated at $5 million</a>. The details of Canan Moodie's salary and the <a href=#>monetary worth</a> of his professional contract with his club remain unknown. Nevertheless, his Instagram bio suggests that he also has a contract with sporting brands like Puma.</p><h3>Social media presence</h3><p class=align-left>Although the youngster is already one of the most talked about Rugby players in South Africa, Canan Moodie's Instagram following does not reflect his <a href=#>celebrity</a> status. The only account associated with him on Instagram is yet to be verified and has under 5,000 followers.</p><p class=align-left>Canon Moodie is still in awe of how his Rugby-playing career has turned out within a short period. Hopefully, his lucky charm continues to glow in potency because, as it seems, Rugby is his for the taking.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Who is Leslee Neshehe?
